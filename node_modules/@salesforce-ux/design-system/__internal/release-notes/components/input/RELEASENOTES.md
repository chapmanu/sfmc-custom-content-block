# Input Release Notes

<!-- ## [Unreleased] -->

## 2.12.0

## 2.11.7

## 2.10.2

### Fixed

## 2.10.0

### Added

- Updated documentation to state that iconLeft and fixed text labels are incompatible.

### Changed

- Removed default `box-shadow` on `inputs` for Webkit

- For touch devices:
  - Increase the line-height to `$height-tappable` (2.75rem) for an improved tap target
  - For read-only inputs, increase the font size to `$font-size-5` (1rem) for consistency with the font sizes of other inputs
  - Positioning of icons inside of inputs have been tweaked

## 2.8.0
